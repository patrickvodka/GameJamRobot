The theme of the game jam is "restart." The team decided to create a game featuring a robot that must escape a level with three lives. 
Each time it dies, its body explodes, ejecting the player and any items within its radius. Only clones can interact with the player. 
The clone robot functions similarly to Super Meat Boy, allowing players to see their previous path. However, players can use the dead body for boosts: a jump boost if they are on it, and a speed boost if they are in front of it.

The main mechanic of the game involves progressing through the level by utilizing the "past selves," which explode and propel the player. 
Players also have the option to voluntarily commit suicide, making every pit accessible since they can jump into the gap. 
As soon as they respawn with their second life, they can jump over the gap at the right moment to be ejected by the death of their clone, allowing them to escape the level. 
Players can move and jump in 2D, allowing for dynamic exploration of the levels. By combining the explosions of the clones with strategic jumps, players must skillfully navigate through obstacles to reach the exit.

Over 20 levels have been created by the game designers and level designers. ![GIT_GAMEJAMRobot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57339140-6d1e-416d-804e-dd29322b723a)
